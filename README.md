# McFanta_'s Simple Calculator

Hello there!

Welcome to my repository. This repository is used for the calculator I programmed for Windows systems with C#. This calculator is simple to program because of the language C# is a simple language. The calculator is pretty much very basic. You can view a screenshot down below. I programmed this on a program by Microsoft called Visual Studio 2015 the community edition. You can download Visual Studio 2015 <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978&clcid=0x409">here</a> if you are interested to try it out. If you are interested to learn more about programming with C# you can rather look it up at YouTube, buy a C# book or read tutorials on the internet. That's what I recommend. More information down below. 

<h3>Downloading the calculator</h3>
